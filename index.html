                common... and then bam! Someone plays the networking card.
                And everything about your interaction changes.
                Put away the hard-charging, goal-oriented, always-on persona. If you have to ask for something, find a
                way to help the other person, then ask if you can.
                Remarkably likable u focus on what they can do for you -- not for ur self.

                at least for me ur empathic since u understands a person's feelings, accompanied by altruism, or ur

              <p>
                In this year i don't really know how much u planning to stay on 22 but ya, it will be worth it cuz in this
                year everything thing is a possiblitiy
                cuz its perfect year and age to to do everything and u know it too, for example u can chill like there is no tomorow 🥳🍻🍻 and
                and next morning u still young , gorgeous and its fine
                and u can do that as much u want cuz its the time and it feels right or in another way u can work u ass
                off 👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧 and start new buisness or get hired to some company
                but its  the perfect time and age to get money cuz u have tons things to spend it on, or in another
                way u can stay home to help ur family with house stuff till u settled
                with ur life and thas fine cuz in the next morning ur still young and fresh lots possiblities or u can
                start familly of ur own that's possiblitiy too cuz its the right time
                to do nearly anything cuz what ever u decide on ur life this the perfect age to it , except one thing
                giving up on ur dreams, ur beliefs, loving ur self, ur confidence , yourself
                that's one thing u can't do at this stage , like i told u can do something shitty in this year but in
                the next day u got to start walking again with full energy even if
                that is something that is going to hold u down for a while u shouldn't let it , i know u got a winner ,
                leader heart so don't let anything fuck that up that includes ur self.the last thing i want to
                to see in u is dead but u would rather be dead rather than giving up on urself , giving on ur dreams so
                u get the point , so don't ever think about falling to trap
                so this year is possiblility live with it, fun with it, cherish with it , work with it , make this year
                of ur life the year that you did everything in ur power to win this mad world
                which always put to the ground so tell to ur slef u can win it.but one thing i can assure u  it's not
                because that we only want to u if u only succeed in life that's not the case at all , actually the real deal is
                whatever upside down u are in i am always going to be here for u , i just badly want it u to succeed in
                this life that's it eshe yenie wd. so love this year love year of possiblility!!!!

      Another year has passed
      It’s time to celebrate once more
      Since it’s the birthday of
      The one I so adore.
      Someone as unique and 
      as important as you are to me
      Deserves their special day
      To be as wonderful as can be.
      
      Happy birthday, my dear.
